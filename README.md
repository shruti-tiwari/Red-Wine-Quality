In this project, I have analyzed the variables influencing the quality of the red wine. The dataset has 13 variables and 1599 observations. In my analysis, I have removed the first variable which is a unique identification number. The output variable is quality and I analyzed the features influencing the quality of the red wine. The dataset is in the file named redWineQuality.csv.
