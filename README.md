# Red-Wine-Quality-Analysis-using-R

## Project Description
In this project, I have analyzed the variables influencing the quality of the red wine. 

The dataset has 13 variables and 1599 observations. In this analysis, I have removed the first variable which is a unique identification number. The output variable is quality and I analyzed the features influencing the quality of the red wine.

The dataset is in the file named redWineQuality.csv.

## Conclusion

I chose this data set of quality of red wine as this is a field, I am completely unaware of. By the time I finished it I can say I know more than many about what makes a red wine great. 
Just after analysing a few major features of this data sets I realized that this data set is missing the band width which is important to give a strong theory about the quality of wine. 
In this analysis, I found that higher quality red wine usually tends to have higher percentage of alcohol per volume but higher quality does not ensure higher percentage of alcohol. On the other hand, higher quality do ensure lower volatile acidity(acetic acid) in wine which is often attained by higher sulphates in red wine. The dependence of citric acid on quality of the red wine is also consistent. We can safely say that higher citric acid indicates better quality of the wine but not vice-versa.

In this dataset 4 variables seem to affect the quality of the wine but apparently there are more important variables are in play which had not been included in this dataset.
